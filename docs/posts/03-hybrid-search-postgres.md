# Post 3 — "Hybrid search on Postgres: pgvector + full-text"

Publish after: Day 17 (v0.3.0) · Fed by days: 13–17 · Format: text + 2–3 images

## Hook
Every deploy wiped my app's search index — users still saw their documents, but retrieval
returned nothing. Moving vector + keyword search into Postgres fixed persistence, deletion and
per-user filtering in one move.

## Concepts to explain (plain words)
- Embeddings and cosine similarity
- Brute-force vs. ANN search; how HNSW works at a high level
- Keyword search: BM25 vs. Postgres full-text ranking
- Hybrid search — why you want both
- Pre-filtering vs. post-filtering for multi-tenant search
- Embedding dimensions (3072 → 1536) and the quality trade-off
- Batch embedding and a content-hash embedding cache

## Outline
1. Hook: the vanishing index
2. Before: in-memory FAISS + BM25, filter after search
3. After: one `document_chunks` table (vector + tsvector + user_id)
4. HNSW in one picture
5. Hybrid query: vector + full-text in SQL
6. Results: recall before/after, upload time before/after
7. Deletes and re-uploads now just work (cascade, content hash)
8. Lesson + repo link

## Visuals needed
- [ ] Architecture diagram: before vs. after
- [ ] Table/ERD: `document_chunks` columns and indexes
- [ ] Chart: Recall@5 FAISS vs. pgvector; upload time per 50-page PDF before/after
- [ ] Code card: the hybrid SQL query
